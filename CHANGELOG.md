[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Go module path is now `github.com/mahasenabheetha/codec/v2`; requires Go 1.26+.
- Building from source needs Node.js for the web UI (see README).

### Added

- Foundation for the v2 web UI (Svelte 5 + TypeScript) at `/app/`.
- CI runs on Windows as well as Linux.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-26

First tagged release: codec as it stood before the 2.0 work began.

### Added

- CLI commands: `auto` (detect and transform), `b64 encode|decode` with
  `--url` for the URL-safe alphabet, `json pretty|min|validate`, and
  `jwt decode`. Input comes from an argument or stdin.
- `--copy` / `-c` global flag to also place output on the clipboard.
- `watch` mode: transforms recognizable clipboard content in place.
- Ansible `-vv` task log analysis: status, probable-cause diagnosis,
  summary chips, prettified commands, and severity-colored output.
- `serve`: local web UI on `127.0.0.1` with explicit modes,
  transform-on-paste, click-to-jump JSON errors, and PWA install support.
- `version` command, `--version` flag, and `GET /api/version`; the web
  UI footer shows the running version.
- Release pipeline: pushing a `v*` tag publishes binaries for Linux,
  Windows and macOS (amd64/arm64) to GitHub Releases via GoReleaser.
